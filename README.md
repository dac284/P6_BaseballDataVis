Udacity NanoDegree Project 6 - Creating a data visualization for a baseball dataset

### Summary

The project provides a data visualization of a small sample of baseball statistics.
I use a scatterplot to view the relation between batting average and home runs.
I also add color to explore the handedness of the players and add animation/interaction
to view some of the best players.

### Design

I chose a scatterplot because I wanted to see the relation between two quantitative 
variables. I used color to encode handedness as this is an unordered categorical variable.
I used transitions to zoom in on the best players and added mouseover interaction as an
easy way to view the names of some of the best players.
